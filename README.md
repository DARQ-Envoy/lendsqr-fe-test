# Lendsqr Fe Test

 My name is Timothy. As a result of my desire to join the team, I have taken up the assessment for frontend engineers. In order to take up the assessment, I had to commit more than 7 days of intensive hardwork. I went from reasearching to prototyping to developing. In order to carry out the assessment, I had to do a lot of Google searches and I also employed more tools in order to aquire more knowledge that would enable me to carry out the project. 

I was not able to complete the assessment in the alloted time but I believe that what I built would give evidence to my expertise.
I wish to assure you that I am fully aware of any differences that exists between the design and my project. Some of these differences were the results of critical calculations I made to make the webapp fit into my screen, but as a result of the exhausted time limit, I made no provisions for other screens. Since 2021, I have been building mobile responsive webapps and ensuring pixel-perfect implementation of designs.
I started with designs from frontendmentor.io then later on I implemented designs from figma, adobe xd, dribble and so on. So I can assure you that I have no problems what so ever in achieving pixel perfect implementation. 

In this application, I focused more on the data fetching, struturing and handling aspect. I also focused on how to ensure the speed and performance of the app when handling larger amounts of userdata or any type of data.  

Here are some points to note about this project:
- Following your instructions, the data is fetched from the api and stored in local storage and from that point onward is fetched from local storage 

- I created multiple custom pure functions that process data and provide result that can be rendered in the dom. Those functions can be found in the following path: src/utility/processors.ts . 

- In the data-structure file, using typescript, I created types for data and structured those types to make more complex types. That can be found in the following path: src/utility/data-structure.ts 

- I created a file name extractor which is a function that extracts the names of files and uses them to name links. I implemented this function in the case of the lender nav links.

- In the logic file, I created a function that returns an async function that get intercepted by the thunk middleware and used to both consume the api fetching the required data and dispatching actions to get that data stored. That can be found in the following path: src/utility/logic.ts

- My keen attention to detail 

- I did a lot of reasearch in order to carry out this project and this is something I appreciate about myself. I don't rely on just what I know. I seek knowledge in order to accomplish things.

- The fields on the login page are required.

- I implemented the design to best fit my screen but because of time exhaustion, I could not do the same for other screens.

- I am proficient in writing test in react, employing tools such as Jest, just as I am proficient in writing tests in django like unit tests, view tests, automated tests and so on. 

## Overall, I encourage you to look into my source code especially the utility folder which can be found in the src folder. It is proof of the hardwork and dedication I put into this project. An interview would no doubt convince you of my expertise.




# A Self Taught Developer
   I am a self taught software engineer. Being a self taught software engineer means that I am self disciplined and self motivated. As I said earlier, I have built my career for over three years now. If I was not disciplined and self-motivated, I would not come this far.

   I learnt using mostly online resources and courses, so you can be sure that I am proficient at making research. Asides online resources, internships with a lot of companies such as Microsoft, have given me a lot of experience and taught me a lot of skills.

   Most developers are not like me, I feel victorious when I bring requirements to life. I hope my application would be considered  

   It is my desire to join your dynamic team and I know that with my proficiency, skills and competence as well as my personal traits such as discipline, hardwork, passion and diligence, I would prove to be invaluable to the vision and goals of the company.
